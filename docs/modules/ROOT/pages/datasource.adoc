=== Sqlite

Sqlite only runs as embedded database.

As such, you must specify connection details, or use the defaults.

`jdbc:sqlite:[path]/[name][?key=value...]`

Example:: `jdbc:sqlite:/home/user/mydatabase.db`


SQLite supports on-memory database management, which does not create any database files. To use a memory database in your Java code, get the database connection as follows:


`jdbc:sqlite::memory:`


The https://www.sqlite.org/uri.html[official documentation] or https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/open.html#urifilenameexamples[URI Examples] go into more detail and list optional parameters as well.
